## Note

- Repository hosted at Github is only a **mirror of the [Gitlab's repo](https://gitlab.com/dtsdwarak/dtsdwarak.gitlab.io/tree/master)**. If you're willing to contribute, please send your pull requests to Gitlab.
- Due to restrictions with [Fanboy's Social Blocking List](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/fanboy-social.txt), [Font-Awesome icons are not visible with Adblock-Plus installed](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/1799) as such. So, the class prefix for font-awesome icons have been changed from `fa` to `fu`. If you're planning to extend the site, make sure you stick to the new prefix.
